This is a simple version Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, -- the most widely played casino banking game in the world.
The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points without going over.

In this simple version of the game, the player is played against a computer, whose strategy is fixed. As long as the computer score is less than 17, the computer keeps taking a card. Here are the detailed rules:

The game will use 1 deck of standard playing cards – 4 suits (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts) of 13 cards each (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King).

The computer first gets 2 cards – one is face up and one is face down. The computer and the player only know the value of the face up card.

The human player gets two cards. The current score is the sum of the face values of the cards (numbered cards have a value equal to the number, face cards such as Jacks, Kings, Queens are worth 10, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 as per the player’s wishes).

The human player can choose to get another card. If they do, the new score is the sum of the old score and the value of the new card. If the player score goes over 21, the human player loses. If the score is less than 21, they can HIT, which is to repeat this step as many times as they want.

When the player is happy with the score and doesn’t wish to take any more cards, they can choose to STAND.

Now it’s the computer’s turn.

The computer’s strategy in this game is fixed. As long as the computer score is less than 17, the computer keeps taking a card.

If the computer score goes over 21, the computer loses. 

If not, then the computer score and the human score are compared and the higher score wins.

If the scores are tied, it’s a tie.
